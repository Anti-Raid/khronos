# @antiraid/interop

This plugin allows interoperability with the Luau controller.

## Types

<div id="type.null" />

### null

`null` is a special value that represents nothing. It is often used in AntiRaid instead of `nil` due to issues regarding existence etc. `null` is not equal to `nil` but is also an opaque type.



<div id="type.array_metatable" />

### array_metatable

`array_metatable` is a special metatable that is used to represent arrays across the Lua-AntiRaid templating subsystem boundary. This metatable must be set on all arrays over this boundary and is required to ensure AntiRaid knows the value you're sending it is actually an array and not an arbitrary Luau table.



## Methods

### memusage

```lua
function memusage(): f64
```

Returns the current memory usage of the Lua VM.

#### Returns

- `memory_usage` ([f64](#type.f64)): The current memory usage, in bytes, of the Lua VM.
